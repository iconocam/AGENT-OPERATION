# AGENT-OPERATION

## Good evening, Agents
## As you may have heard, we're re-initializing but expanding this time.

The program we have implemented is to make it easier for you to access

the database. 

For security purposes, you are meant to enter your requested agent information.

When done with entering your information , the complete button will allow you to move further, and the generate data button will now 

load the mission objectives. 

The more you press generate data, the more information you can cycle through. 
### As of right now, this operations program does the following;
Creates a new page container with a grey background.
Adds a paragraph to the new page with the text "This is page two" and a white background.
Adds another paragraph with the text "New Objective Acquired, Task List Pending" and a yellow background.
Generates an array using the generateArray function and adds a cloned version of the new page container to the body.

The code works as intended, except for the fact that I am struggling to implement the data specifics and inputting target information.
